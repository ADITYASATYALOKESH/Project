      <h2>Dynamic Programming or DP</h2>
      <p>
        Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic technique with the following properties.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for the same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization typically reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some popular problems solved using Dynamic Programming are Fibonacci Numbers, Diff Utility (Longest Common Subsequence), Bellmanâ€“Ford Shortest Path, Floyd Warshall, Edit Distance and Matrix Chain Multiplication.

      <h2>
        Dynamic Programming (DP) Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Dynamic Programming is a commonly used algorithmic technique used to optimize recursive solutions when same subproblems are called again.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            The core idea behind DP is to store solutions to subproblems so that each is solved only once.
        </li>
        <li>
            To solve DP problems, we first write a recursive solution in a way that there are overlapping subproblems in the recursion tree (the recursive function is called with the same parameters multiple times)
        </li>
        <li>
            To make sure that a recursive value is computed only once (to improve time taken by algorithm), we store results of the recursive calls.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are two ways to store the results, one is top down (or memoization) and other is bottom up (or tabulation).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Dynamic programming is used for solving problems that consists of the following characteristics:
      </p>
      <h2>1. Optimal Substructure:</h2>
      <p>
        The property Optimal substructure means that we use the optimal results of subproblems to achieve the optimal result of the bigger problem.
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>
        Consider the problem of finding the minimum cost path in a weighted graph from a source node to a destination node. We can break this problem down into smaller subproblems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Find the minimum cost path from the source node to each intermediate node.
        </li>
        <li>
            Find the minimum cost path from each intermediate node to the destination node.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The solution to the larger problem (finding the minimum cost path from the source node to the destination node) can be constructed from the solutions to these smaller subproblems.
      </p>
      <h2>
        2. Overlapping Subproblems:
      </h2>
      <p>
        The same subproblems are solved repeatedly in different parts of the problem refer to Overlapping Subproblems Property in Dynamic Programming.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Example:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Consider the problem of computing the Fibonacci series. To compute the Fibonacci number at index n, we need to compute the Fibonacci numbers at indices n-1 and n-2. This means that the subproblem of computing the Fibonacci number at index n-2 is used twice (note that the call for n - 1 will make two calls, one for n-2 and other for n-3) in the solution to the larger problem of computing the Fibonacci number at index n.
